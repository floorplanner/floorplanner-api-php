Floorplanner API
===============================================================================
The Floorplanner API can be used to access and alter information about users,
projects and designs on the Floorplanner servers.

Note that you will need an API key for most calls to the Floorplanner servers. 
Currently, these API keys are invite-only as we are working on stabilizing the 
API. If you would like to access our API, please send your ideas or proposals 
to sales@floorplanner.com, so we can create an API key for you.


CONTENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package contains a class library to simplify using the RESTful webservice 
on floorplanner.com, and examples to get you started quickly. We plan to 
support multiple languages, but for now only PHP is supported. 

Accessing the API using ActiveResource in Ruby on Rails is possible as well. We 
plan to add some Rails examples as soon as possible.

USAGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
require "inc/floorplanner.php";

$fp = new Floorplanner(API_URL, API_KEY);

// fetch list of users
$users = $fp->getUsers();
foreach($users as $user) {
	// IMPORTANT NOTE: hyphens in FML element-names are replaced by a underscore!
	$externalIdentifier = $user->external_identifier;
}

LICENSE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This code is released under the MIT license.

Although the MIT license does not require giving back your changes, we would
really appreciate it, so we can polish these files and make it as easy as 
possible for others to access our API.


SUPPORT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have any technical questions regarding the use of the API, do not 
hesitate to contact us.
